HIGH PRIORITY

- vc specific error messages
- Substitution of new calls
- Name clashes -> compiler error
- checkInterface -> redefined cclass methods have to keep complete parents throwable list
- ~~~ allowing extends clause for furtherbindings ~~~
- typesystem -> casts, family variables
- outer and deep nesting -> access of outer of outer, in java: static accessor methods


LOW PRIORITY

- incremental compilation
- mixins with support classes for dynamic deployment


WORK DONE

- typesystem graphs
- extended compiler controllflow
- class generator component
- implements clause for cclass


THINK ABOUT IT

- abstract virtual class
- static interfaces in cclass



FUTURE WORK

- Integration into eclipse GUI 
	-> can we use type system graphs for adding extra informations to outline views
- better constructor support -> (see c++ multiple inheritance)
- CIs
