HIGH PRIORITY

- support for binary caesar libraries
- vc specific error messages
- Substitution of new calls
- Name clashes (check on linearized list) -> compiler error
- checkInterface -> redefined cclass methods have to keep complete parents throwable list
- typesystem -> casts, family variables
- outer and deep nesting -> access of outer of outer, in java: static accessor methods
- virtual class scoping! joinAll has to be changed -> for the problem see OuterD in 23


LOW PRIORITY

- incremental compilation
- super calls and calls to fields defined in on of the super classes has been fixed, but:
	the fix doesn't look nice at all -> see AdditionalGenerationContext for more Infos



THINK ABOUT IT

- debug logging! -> log4j
- abstract virtual class
- static interfaces in cclass
- topMostIfc -> merging classes with non common root 


FUTURE WORK

- Integration into eclipse GUI 
	-> can we use type system graphs for adding extra informations to outline views
- better constructor support -> (see c++ multiple inheritance)
- CIs
