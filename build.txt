Building the CaesarJ-Project with ANT

Author: Karl Klose <karl.klose@gmx.de>

The ANT script build.xml includes targets for
1. Generating the scanner files&code
2. Generating the parser files&code
3. Compiling all changed compilation units

Running the build file the first time:
- Right-click on the build.xml file located in the caesar project root
- Select "Run ANT..." from the context-menu
- You are now prompted to select a target (see above) to launch and to choose 
  a name for this "Run as..." entry.
- Click "Run" to run the build.

This configuration has been saved and is accessible through the "Run as..." 
command either in the "Project"-Menu or the toolbar.
You can modify or add configurations by following the same routine as for the
first time.
