Building the CaesarJ-Project with ANT

Author: Karl Klose <karl.klose@gmx.de>

Overview

The ANT script build.xml includes targets for
1. MSGGEN:   Generating CaesarMessages.java
2. SCANNER:  Generating the scanner code
3. PARSER:   Generating the parser code
4. COMPILE:  Compiling all changed compilation units
5. DIST:     Pack a distribution JAR-File
6. COMPLETE: Run targets 1-4

How to run a target

Running the build file the first time:
- Right-click on the build.xml file located in the caesar project root
- Select "Run ANT..." from the context-menu
- You are now prompted to select a target (see above) to launch and to choose 
  a name for this "Run as..." entry.
- Click "Run" to run the build.

This configuration has been saved and is accessible through the "Run as..." 
command either in the "Project"-Menu or the toolbar.
You can modify or add configurations by following the same routine as for the
first time.

Dependencies

Some targets automatically run other targets they depend on:
- DIST:     Runs the compile target to update the classfiles
- COMPLETE: Runs targets 1-4
