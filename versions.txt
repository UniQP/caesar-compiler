VC_9 - 23.07.2004
- ACC_MIXIN modifier added for cclass
- CaesarObject as root for all cclass types has been introduced
- Unit tests has been extended and reorganized 
	- separate compilation of tests
	- every test in separated package
- Caesar type graph has been redesigned (org.caesarj.compiler.typesys)
	- No separated graphs for complete and declaration graphs
	- graph transofrmations moved to separate graph visitors
- Bytecode generation for method calls has been patched, 
  introduction of AdditionalGenerationContext for keeping the reference for current caller
  ( KOPI I condemn you! ;) )
	- super call uses direct super of caller as target, rather than the owner of the method
	- access to fields declared in one of parents uses caller as target
	- same for virtual calls and interface calls
	Consequences for: aspectj pointcuts, mixin copies and method calls


VC_8 - 08.07.2004
- inner cclass always static ->
	* outer passed as extra ctor parameter (work todo)
	* outer accessed via interface (work todo)


VC_7 - ??.07.2004
- added extra AST Elements for virtual class and cclass interface
- added caesar specific compiler messages
- interface generation changed ->
	* support classes for dynamic interfaces not implemented by impl class itself,
	  but rather by cclass interface
- ctors reduced to only default paramter-less one ->
	* using of init methods
- Class Mixer reduced to Class Generator only ->
	features: copy class, replace outer, replace super


VC_6 - 28.06.2004
- type graphs ->
 	* explicit (as declared in caesar code), 
	* complete (including implicit types), 
	* java (mapped back to java)
- super type adjustment
- cclass interface creation
- implicit type creation
- ctors with free parameters
- ctors inheritance
- factory methods automatically created
- class generator still not integrated
